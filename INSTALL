Compiling Qpid-CMS
==================

Prerequisites:

Qpid-CMS has some prerequites that need to be present before it can be built:

It relies on the Qpid client library (qpid::messaging) for its underlying messaging
API and the Qpid Proton library for the AMQP 1.0 protocol implementation.

Minimum known working versions are:

qpid-cpp 0.28 (0.26 is known to have bugs that will cause problems)
qpid-proton 0.7

In order to build Qpid-CMS you will require cmake:

cmake 2.6

In order to build the Unit tests you will require Boost Test

Getting the source:

You can find the source for qpid-cms in github:
Get using this command:
    git clone git@github.com:astitcher/qpid-cms.git

This repository uses a git submodule to pull in what it needs from the activemq-cms git
repository to set this up use these commands:
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Building from source:

The simplest (and recommended) way to build qpid-cms is to use the same install prefix
for qpid-cms as for qpid and qpid-proton.

In this case follow the build instructions you will find with the qpid and qpid-proton
source.

Having done this create a directory set aside to build qpid-cms:
    mkdir build

Now run cmake in the directory pointing it at the unpacked source directory for qpid-cms
and specifying the install prefix used for qpid and qpid-proton:
    cmake <qpid-cms source> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install prefix used for qpid>

This will configure the build, now you can build it with make:
    make

You can run the unit tests
    ./tests/UnitTests

There are small examples to examine and run in the examples directory.

Assuming all goes well you can install the library in the same place as the qpid libraries:
    sudo make install
    [sudo is not needed if you are only installing in a non-system directory]
